**გამარჯობა!**

Hey, I'm Josh! I moved to Georgia and started learning this fascinating language in the spring of 2025. Welcome to my digital notebook!

On this site I am cataloguing my journey of learning the Georgian language.  The site is primarily for my own growth and reflection, but you might find something here that helps you too.

One day I would like to reach an upper intermediate level and be able to easily converse with people in Georgian.

Good luck to everyone on this journey, myself included :)
