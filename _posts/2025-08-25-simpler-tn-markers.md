TN markers distinguish the time (or screeve) and number (singular/plural) of Georgian verb conjugations.

Sadly, TN markers are different across every screeve, unlike person markers.

Thankfully, certain "sister" screeves share TN markers.

In general, the TN markers for present and future screeves are the same, and they are also the same between the imperfect and conditional screeves.

If you look up verb conjugations, you will see that for the 6 subjects (მე, შენ...), the endings are generally the same for present and future, and the imperfect and conditional screeves are also generally the same.

So if you learn four sets of TN markers (present & future, imperfect & conditional, aorist, optative), you can use each of these 6 screeves.

Yay for simplifications!
