What the heck is a PFSF?

PFSF stands for the present future stem formant. It is also sometimes called a thematic suffix.

So what is it?

A single syllable immediately before the TN markers in certain screeves (present, future, imperfect, conditional, plus maybe some other lesser used screeves).

What's it for?

Not sure totally, but I think it just helps distinguish the above mentioned screeves from the aorist/optative.

How do I find it?

Look at the შენ form in the present tense and take off the last syllable, ie კითხულობ has a pfsf of ობ. 

Common pfsfs are ებ, ევ, ავ, ამ, ი, ობ.

If you look at a conjugation table for a verb, you will notice that the aorist and optative forms don't have the pfsf, but the present, future, imperfect, and conditional do.

How does this help?

I found that once I learned the anatomy of Georgian verbs, I could recognize and memorize them more easily. Verb conjugtations follow the basic formula

preverb + person marker + verb root + verb pfsf + tn marker

Some screeves don't have a preverb (present, imperfect). Others don't have a pfsf (aorist, optative). Once I saw this, the conjugations became a little less overwhelming and more memorable.

When you learn new verbs, you can intensely focus on what the verb root is, and I think that makes them easier to memorize and distinguish between verbs. Try it sometime; if two verbs are easily confused, just focus on the verb root.

So... yeah, anything to make it a little easier!
