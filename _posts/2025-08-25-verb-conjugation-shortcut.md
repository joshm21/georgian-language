This might be obvious to most people, but I noticed something that made verb conjugations seem less overwhelming.

*Note the following is a massive simplification, but at this point in my journey, it's a helpful framework.*

In short, if you know 2 verb forms, you can quickly guess all the other conjugations. This assumes you know the person and tn markers for different screeves.

The key forms are the 2nd person singular (შენ) present and aorist forms.

If you compare these two forms, you can see
1. the preverb - the extra letters at the beginning of the aorist form
2. the pfsf - the extra letters at the ending of the present form

With this info, you can conjugate verbs in different screeves. For example, the verb გაკეთება (to do, make)

present = აკეთებ\
aorist = გააკეთე\
preverb = გა\
pfsf = ებ

future = preverb + present = გა-აკეთებ\
imperfect = present, but different ending = აკეთებდი\
conditional = preverb + imperfect = გააკეთებდი\
optative = aorist, but different ending = გააკეთო

(these are the main screeves used in conversation)

What if I don't want the შენ form? You can use the general formulas below. Notice the paired "sister" screeves are almost identical.

present = person marker + verb root + pfsf + tn marker\
future = preverb + present

imperfect = like the present, but different tn marker\
conditional = preverb + imperfect

aorist = preverb + person marker + verb root + tn marker (note: no pfsf)\
optative = like aorist, but different tn marker

We're in this struggle together!
